# ðŸŒŒ Hungerland Hardcore / DayZ
*My most important project at the moment.*

## ðŸ“– Storyline

The world of **Hungerland** has collapsed.  
Stranded on a remote **archipelago**, no one knows why they are here â€“ only one thing is certain:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Survival is everything.**

The beginning is merciless: no experience, no resources, no allies.  
But the deeper you explore this **multi-layered world**, the more paths open up:  
- discover hidden locations,  
- master unique skills,  
- defeat bosses,  
- forge alliances.  

In the end, only your strategy decides whether you **survive or perish**.
