# 🖥️ Selfhosting – full control

Instead of using a hosting provider, my server runs entirely on my own hardware. This means I take care of everything myself – from updates to backups.

✨ Highlights:

⚡ Two low-power Lenovo systems: Each running below 100W consumption

🔄 Failover ready: If one system goes down, the second one instantly takes over → seamless operation without downtime

🔧 Full responsibility: Updates, backups, crash logs, monitoring

🛡️ Security & stability: No dependency on third-party hosts

🎮 Close to the community: Changes can be tested and applied instantly

💡 Selfhosting forces you to truly understand every single detail – turning server management into a real project.
